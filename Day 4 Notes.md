# Day 4
- Only Nick and Ilmari had their numbers increase. Nick w/ 2 and Ilmari w/ 3
- Zurga and Uzax still alive
- I saved Damian with my "visions"
- We went to the toll both under the hospital
- Past the hospital is an area with lots of what appear to be barracks and an abandoned factory
- The guards seemed to usher us through the area quickly, and not give us an opportunity to explore the buildings
- We exit Plaguestone and still find ourselves awoken in plaguestone

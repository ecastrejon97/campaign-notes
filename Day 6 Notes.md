- Ilmari got her fortune read
	- 3 of Wands: Progress, foresight, unexpected delay
	- "Doom is coming to this town, but not tonight"
- We go to the hospital, and go under a Zone of Truth by Ophie to try to convince her that Rune is up to something
- Rune interrupted us, and Ophie left without dropping the Zone, causing Koll to spill all the beans about this
- Rune seems to also know that something wierd is going on in the town, she invites us to her office
- The baby never dies
- The deaths are not connected to the time loop, according to Rune
- Rune believes the time loop is originating inside the hospital
- There is an entrance to the underground caves in the well in the center of town
- We take a look at the other patient in the hospital, with yellow skin and red hair

## Into the Depths
- We explore the well
- We find 25 child graves
- As well as 3-4 skeletons of children
- The skeletons range from 10 to 13 years old at time of death
- The graves and skeletons seem to have been here ranging from 15 to 20 years
- Some ghosty things attacked us after Uzax touched the bones
- They screeched "BETRAYAL"
- The spirits were manifested by (un)dead children, who just sobbed once their incorporeal visages disappated
- After consoling both the children, Ilmari and Koll both had one less number on their palms
